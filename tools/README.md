# Temporary Release Process
This directory is structured based on the [Ontology Development Kit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit). However, full testing and integration have not been set up to release ontologies per this process. This is an area of active development.

In the interim, `rubric_release.sh` is a temporary release process. This process performs the following tasks:

1. Merge `src/ontology/rubric-edit.owl`.
1. Annotate using the current date.
1. Report.
1. Reason.
